Description: Analyzes shooting data with respect to group shape,
        precision, and accuracy. This includes graphical methods,
        descriptive statistics, and inference tests using standard,
        but also non-parametric and robust statistical methods.
        Implements distributions for radial error in bivariate normal
        variables. Works with files exported by 'OnTarget PC/TDS',
        'Silver Mountain' e-target, 'ShotMarker' e-target, or 'Taran',
        as well as with custom data files in text format.
        Supports inference from range statistics like extreme spread.
        Includes a set of web-based graphical user interfaces.
