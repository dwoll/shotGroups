Description: Analyzes shooting data with respect to group shape,
        precision, and accuracy. This includes graphical methods,
        descriptive statistics, and inference tests using standard,
        but also non-parametric and robust statistical methods.
        Implements distributions for radial error in bivariate normal
        variables. Works with files exported by 'OnTarget PC/TDS',
        'Silver Mountain' e-target, 'ShotMarker' e-target, 'SIUS'
        e-target, or 'Taran', as well as with custom data files in
        text format. Supports inference from range statistics such as
        extreme spread. Includes a set of web-based graphical user
        interfaces.
