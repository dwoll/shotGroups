    * groupLocation()
      - for bootstrap-CIs of center, sample (x,y)-coords simultaneously
        instead of bootstrapping x, y separately
      - report parametric CIs and bootstrap CIs for center x, y in the same
        list components, respectively, with new names ctrXci, ctrYci
      - remove option unit as it can be inferred from option conversion
      - option caliber now needs to be given in mm
      - add option level to select CI level
      - values for option target are now called "BDS25m" and "DSB25m"
      - bugfix for plotting a target with imperial measurement units
    * groupShape()
      - add option outlier to select which outlier identification method to
        use - outlier='mcd' is as before, 'pca' uses the robust principal
        components analysis from mvoutlier::pcout()
    * groupSpread()
      - report parametric and bootstrap confidence intervals for (x,y)
        standard deviations in separate list components, and add MOA
      - report empirical median as well as mean distance to center, add
        option to report either Rayleigh or Gauss estimates for precision
        parameter sigma, radial standard deviation RSD, and mean radius MR
      - report parametric and bootstrap confidence intervals for sigma, RSD,
        MR
      - report width, height, figure of merit and diagonal for (minimum)
        bounding box
      - add option CEPtype to select which CEP estimate to report
      - add Rayleigh fit to histogram of distances to group center
    * groupLocation(), groupShape(), groupSpread(), getBoundingBox(),
      getCEP(), getConfEll(), getDistToCtr(), getMaxPairDist(),
      getMinBBox(), getMinCircle()
      - make generic with methods to also accept a data frame either with
        variables Point.X, Point.Y or X, Y
    * fromMOA()
      - bugfix increasing numerical precision for large sizes
    * readData*()
      - default is now combine=TRUE
    * readDataMisc()
      - coordinates of points of impact can be named either X, Y or Point.X,
        Point.Y
      - all variables besides coordinates of points are now optional - default
        values for other variables will be used with a warning
    * DFlistInch, DFlistSavage, DFlistTalon
      - remove lists of data frames as they serve no purpose beyond DFlistCm
    * Documentation improvements

Version 0.2-2 (December 05, 2013)

    * Remove modeltools, KernSmooth from Depends field
      (boot is not moved to Imports because package energy depends on boot)
    * getMinCircle()
      - fix bug where minimal circle is not identified correctly if it only
        touches the convex hull in two points
        thanks: Karl Schilling
    * getDevice()
      - since RStudio keeps past diagrams, open diagrams in the same device
        instead of opening new windows
    * compareGroups()
      - use more sensible colors

Version 0.2-1 (May 07, 2012)

    * Make opening several new plot windows work under RStudio which
      currently (0.95.265) cannot deal with multiple calls to dev.new()
    * getXYmat()
      - new utility function to extract the matrix of (x,y)-coordinates
        relative to point of aim from a data frame
    * getMinBBox()
      - fix bug where orientation angle would sometimes be that of the shorter
        (not longer) edge, slightly faster implementation

Version 0.2 (March 13, 2012)

    * compareGroups()
      - better naming of columns in returned matrices to identify original
        group
      - return correlation matrices of (x,y)-coordinates (instead of
        covariance matrices)
      - fix bug for plotting data from more than 8 groups
    * groupShape()
      - return correlation matrix of (x,y)-coordinates
      - better y-axis limits for histograms
      - chi^2 Q-Q-plot of (robust Mahalanobis distances)^2: reference line now
        has intercept 0 and slope 1, sample quantiles are on the y-axis
    * groupSpread()
      - don't return correlation matrix of (x,y)-coordinates (only covariance
        matrix)
      - option to select the confidence level for the confidence ellipse
      - return size, aspect ratio and flattening of the confidence ellipse
      - return modified RAND R-234 estimate for the circular error probable
      - return parametric 95%-confidence intervals for the standard deviations
        of x- and y-coordinates
    * getConfEll()
      - new function to return measures of a confidence ellipse
    * getCEP()
      - new function to return estimates for the circular error probable (CEP)
    * DFsavage, DFtalon
      - new datasets with groups a rifle at 100 to 300m
        thanks: Charles & Paul McMillan
    * getMinBBox()
      - more efficient implementation
    * getMinCircle()
      - fix bug for cases where minimum enclosing circle is defined by two
        points
    * drawEllipse()
      - fix bug for ellipse sometimes being slightly misoriented
    * Make functions work when there are only 2 points
    * Leave out robust estimations with less than 4 points

Version 0.1 (March 07, 2012)

    * Initial release
